## About Me

I am currently studying **Cyber Defense** at FIAP, focusing on both offensive and defensive aspects of cybersecurity. I have practical experience through labs on platforms like TryHackMe, where I enhance my technical skills by solving daily challenges.

I actively participate in **Capture The Flag (CTF)** competitions and other hands-on activities that develop my logical thinking, analytical skills, and problem-solving abilities, which are essential in the field of information security.

I am preparing intensively for the **CompTIA Security+** certification exam, scheduled for **July 28th**.

My English proficiency is at an intermediate level (B1), with a focus on technical vocabulary related to cybersecurity. I study the language daily and am capable of understanding technical content, documentation, and videos in English.
