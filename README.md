## 👨‍💻 About Me

📘 I am a **Cyber Defense** student at FIAP, focused on both **offensive and defensive cybersecurity**.  
I have hands-on experience with labs such as **TryHackMe**, where I develop technical skills through daily challenges.

🧠 I actively participate in **CTFs (Capture The Flag)** and other practical activities, improving my logical reasoning, analytical skills, and problem-solving abilities — essential skills in information security.

🎯 Currently, I am intensively preparing for the **CompTIA Security+** certification exam, scheduled for **July 28th**.  

🗣️ English at an intermediate level (B1), focusing on cybersecurity technical vocabulary.  
I study the language daily and can already consume technical content, documentation, and videos in English.
